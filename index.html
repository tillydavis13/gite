  <h1>Gîte de Peryroux</h1>
  <p> Perfectly positioned between the Dordogne and Lot rivers, the Gite de Peryroux provides an ideal base for exploring both of these beautiful areas. Miles and miles of stunning country walking/ cycling/ driving routes are on the doorstep, to take you from bustling markets to the geographic wonders of the famous caves, from canoeing to wine tasting, and close to some of the most beautiful villages in France where you can while away a few hours soaking up the atmosphere and sampling the delicious local fare.

The gite has 4 bedrooms: one on the ground floor with en suite wetroom and wide doors making it accessible for wheelchair users. Upstairs there are 3 further bedrooms, 1 with en suite shower room, with the others sharing the family bathroom.

The large sitting room has comfy sofas and a wood burning stove with doors leading to a private terrace. The kitchen is well equipped to include dishwasher, washing machine and full oven and hob to provide a home from home experience.</p>
